# CircuitDesigner

## Summary

This is the repository for my EPQ Artefact.

It is a circuit simulator app for designing linear circuits, using web technologies to inteface with a Python program implementing SPICE, more specifically the PySpice library.

It is powered and implemented with:

* Client/GUI
  * Standard web technologies
  * Electron.js
   * Run on the Node.js runtime
  
* Internal Logic
  * Python
  * Pyspice (https://pyspice.fabrice-salvaire.fr)
  * NgSpice circuit simulator (https://github.com/ngspice/ngspice)
    * SPICE is a text-based circuit simulation program on which a majority of existing circuit simulator are based. More detail on it can be found in my Artefact report as well as here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPICE

The files in the final version, V1.1, are commented as to try and explain how the program works.
